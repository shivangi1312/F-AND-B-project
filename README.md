Provided insights to the marketing team of a Germany based company

CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India. Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. As a data analyst, my job is to take these survey results and turn them into useful information that the team can use to make decisions and take action.
